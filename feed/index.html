<p>Nearly every design method can fit the finest UI design instruments and hopefully satisfy your creative needs. Now is such a wonderful time to discover fresh instruments and see what your projects can be designed and showcased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, with so many UI development instruments out there, which are you supposed to use? The combination of Sketch and InVision has been a common option for many developers over the past few years, but other instruments have provided competitive characteristics and alternatives. There was never a better range of prototyping and wireframe instruments out there, so we believed it was a nice time to look at some of them more closely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="wireframing">Wireframing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="01-mockflow">01. MockFlow</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left","width":267,"height":150} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft is-resized"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="20 best UI design tools: MockFlow" width="267" height="150" />
<figcaption>MockFlow enables you to build basic layouts quickly</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://mockflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MockFlow</a> is a suite of applications that are very useful in the typical project process for a number of tasks. The WireframePro app is primarily an excellent alternative prototyping instrument that you can use, particularly if you are testing fresh thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Take a look at MockFlow if you just need to generate wireframes. It&#8217;s wonderful to work on original concepts and allows you to rapidly create fundamental layouts, which is all you need to get thoughts into a presentable form at times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="02-balsamiq">02. Balsamiq</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="20 best UI design tools: Balsamiq" />
<figcaption>Balsamiq&#8217;s drag-and-drop elements make life easier</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> If you&#8217;re searching for fast wireframing, Balsamiq is a powerful proposal. You can easily create your project framework and layouts rapidly. The components drag and drop create the life simpler and you can link buttons to other websites. This implies you can begin planning your interfaces rapidly and then share them with your team or customers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="03-axure">03. Axure</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="20 best UI design tools: Axure" />
<figcaption>Axure&#8217;s a great tool for more complex projects</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.axure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axure</a> has always been one of the market&#8217;s finest wireframing instruments and is good for more complicated projects requiring vibrant information. With Axure, you can really concentrate on mocking more technical projects and need additional attention when it comes to structure and information.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="05-sketch">04. Sketch</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="20 best UI design tools: Sketch" />
<figcaption>Sketch is the go-to choice for loads of designers</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sketch</a> is a very common instrument for creating hi-fi interfaces and prototypes within the design community. One of the excellent characteristics is Symbols, where UI assets and reuse components can be designed. This helps to create systems for designing and maintaining consistent interfaces. You can export your design to a clickable prototype readily from there. If you are a user of InVision, please check the Craft plugin (more on this below)</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="06-invision-studio">05. InVision Studio</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="20 best UI design tools: InVision Studio" />
<figcaption>With InVision Studio you can create a responsive design on a single artboard</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many UI designers&#8217; dreams are about to come true with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">InVision Studio</a>, the dreams of many UI developers are about to come true. This tool will assist you to produce lovely interactive interfaces with a bucket load of characteristics even in its early release. From a range of gestures and relationships, you can generate custom animations and transitions. You can also stop thinking about developing countless artboards for various devices because you can achieve responsive design within a single artboard. This saves a lot of time, allowing you to think about more thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="07-craft">06. Craft</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="UI design tools" />
<figcaption>Craft is a must-have for Sketch or Photoshop users</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You need to use <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/craft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Craft</a> if you are using Sketch or Photoshop for UI design. This plugin does everything, synchronizing your files seamlessly with your Invision prototypes, and adding actual information to your mock-ups and storing photography.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="08-proto-io">07. Proto.io</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:image {"align":"left"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft"><img src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/creativebloq/media/img/missing-image.svg" alt="20 best UI design tools: Proto.io" />
<figcaption>Proto.io can take you from rough sketch to lifelike prototype</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image --><!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://proto.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proto.io</a> is an incredible contender to create lifelike prototypes ranging from rough concepts to full-fledged designs. The tool also offers plenty of opportunities for your projects, including thorough animations as well as custom vector animations. You can begin with the development of original concepts with a hand-drawn style, then work them into wireframes and end with a prototype of high fidelity. If you want to design using other instruments, the Sketch and Photoshop plugins really assist, but Proto.io handles the end-to-end design process well. Other characteristics such as user testing will assist validate your designs as well. This is an all-in-one solution that already uses a large number of trusted brands</p>
